face.report searches the web on your behalf and determines if your face has been uploaded without your knowledge. This is an important emerging issue to solve, as AI-generated images and videos can be used with malicious intent to cause major reputational harm. Women especially have been targets of such attacks, and are often belittled, humiliated, and intimidated by the technology.
